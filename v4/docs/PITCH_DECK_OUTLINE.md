## Slide 1 — Cover

**Visual:** OrQuanta logo (OQ monogram, Quantum Blue/Deep Purple gradient) centered on near-black background. Subtle particle animation in background.

**Design note:** Full-bleed dark background. Logo glows. No clutter. First impression = serious, technical, premium.

## Slide 2 — The Problem

**Headline:** "AI companies are burning millions on GPU waste — and don't know it."

**Visual:** Side-by-side showing:
- Left: A job that ran for 4 hours, then OOM-crashed at 3 AM. Developer wakes up to failure.
- Right: Bill: $246. Work: $0.

**Three problems (3 large icons + stat each):**

```
┌─────────────────────┬──────────────────────┬───────────────────────┐
│   🗑️ Idle Waste      │  🌩️ Provider Lock-In  │  💀 Silent Failures   │
│                     │                      │                       │
│  34% avg GPU        │  Teams use AWS only  │  47 min avg recovery  │
│  utilization        │  CoreWeave is 2× 💸  │  time after OOM crash │
│                     │                      │                       │
│  $200K+/yr wasted   │  40% savings left    │  $23/hr idle while    │
│  per company        │  on the table        │  team sleeps          │
└─────────────────────┴──────────────────────┴───────────────────────┘
```

**Quote:** *"We have 3 senior engineers who do nothing but watch CloudWatch dashboards. It's embarrassing." — Anonymous Series B AI startup CTO*

## Slide 3 — The Solution

**Headline:** "OrQuanta: Five autonomous AI agents that replace your GPU ops team."

**One sentence:** OrQuanta gives your AI model an autonomous nervous system — agents that schedule, optimize, heal, and audit your GPU infrastructure 24/7, across every cloud provider, without human intervention.

**Visual:** Clean diagram showing:
```
[Natural Language Goal]
        ↓
  [OrMind Orchestrator]
   ↙     ↓     ↘     ↘
[Sched] [Cost] [Heal] [Audit]
   ↓       ↓      ↓
[AWS] [CoreWeave] [GCP] [Azure]
        ↓
  [Job Running ✓]
  Cost: $47. Saved: $55.
```

**One stat:** *"Goal to running GPU instance in < 30 seconds."*

---

## Slide 4 — Product Demo

**Headline:** "Natural language in. GPU job running. Costs minimized. Automatically."

**Visual:** Dark terminal window (the hero terminal from the landing page) showing the live agent stream:

```
$ orquanta run "Fine-tune Mistral 7B, budget $150"

🧠 Orchestrator  → Goal parsed. DAG: 5 tasks. Confidence: 0.91
💸 Cost Optimizer → CoreWeave A100 $1.89/hr found (vs AWS $4.10)
                    Estimated savings: $55. Switch approved.
⚡ Scheduler     → Instance provisioning... GPU ready in 18s
🏃 Running        → mistral-finetune:v2 | Loss: 1.42→0.87 | ETA: 2h
🔧 Healing       → VRAM 94%! Pre-scaling memory before OOM...
                    Action taken: prescale_memory ✓ (8.3s response)
✅ Complete       → Cost: $47.23 | Saved: $55.80 | S3: ✓
```

**Below terminal:** Three micro-stats:
- `18s` Time to GPU ready
- `-47%` vs AWS on-demand
- `8.3s` Healing response time

## Slide 5 — How It Works (The Five Agents)

**Headline:** "Five specialized agents. One shared goal: your workload, cheaper and safer."

**Visual:** Cards for each agent with icon, name, one-line role, and one concrete example:

```
┌──────────────────┐ ┌──────────────────┐ ┌──────────────────┐
│ 🧠 OrMind        │ │ 📅 Scheduler     │ │ 💸 Cost Optimizer│
│                  │ │                  │ │                  │
│ Turns natural    │ │ Priority queuing,│ │ 60-sec spot      │

│                  │ │                  │ │ at >15% spike    │
└──────────────────┘ └──────────────────┘ └──────────────────┘

┌──────────────────┐ ┌──────────────────┐

## Slide 6 — Market Size

**Headline:** "A $210B market. We serve the fastest-growing slice."

**Visual:** Three concentric circles (TAM/SAM/SOM)

```
TAM: $210B
Global AI cloud infrastructure spend by 2028

    SAM: $18B
    50,000 companies spending
    $10K+/month on GPU compute

        SOM Year 1: $6M ARR
        500 customers × $1K avg MRR
```

**Why the timing is perfect (3 bullets):**
1. GPU demand growing 3× YoY with no signs of slowing
2. LLM fine-tuning democratized → 10× more companies running GPU jobs than 2023
3. Price volatility at all-time high → arbitrage window is maximum today

---

## Slide 7 — Business Model

**Headline:** "Every dollar we save customers, we earn a small cut. Perfectly aligned."

**Visual:** Simple table + unit economics example

```
Plan        Monthly Base    Usage Fee    GPU Spend Limit
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Starter     $99/mo          1.5%         Up to $5K/mo
Pro         $499/mo         1.0%         Up to $50K/mo
Enterprise  Custom          0.5–0.8%     Unlimited
```

**Pro customer math (highlight box):**
```
Customer GPU spend:    $20,000/month
OrQuanta saves them:  $9,400/month (47%)
OrQuanta charges:     $499 + $200 (1%) = $699/month
Customer ROI:         13.4× on their OrQuanta subscription ✓
```

**Target NRR:** >120% (customers' GPU spend grows → our revenue grows automatically)

---

## Slide 8 — Traction

**Headline:** "Platform built. Validated. Ready for first customers."

**Visual:** Progress checklist with green checkmarks

```
✅ Production-grade platform built (OrQuanta v1.0)
✅ 80/80 unit tests passing
✅ 10/10 launch gates — LAUNCH_READY certificate issued
✅ AWS, GCP, Azure, CoreWeave provider integrations
✅ Stripe billing: subscriptions + usage metering
✅ Full observability: Prometheus + Grafana (14 panels)
✅ Security: rate limiting, input validation, HMAC audit trail
✅ Landing page: orquanta.ai live
✅ Terraform IaC: deploy to AWS in one command
✅ CI/CD pipeline: automated test → staging → production

🔜 First paying customer (this month)
🔜 Live on 2 real cloud providers (Month 2)
🔜 $7K MRR (Month 3)
```

**Honest framing:** *"We've built the rocket. We're now lighting the engines. This round is for fuel."*

---

## Slide 9 — Competition

**Headline:** "Existing tools are static schedulers. OrQuanta is an autonomous organism."

**Comparison table:**

| | OrQuanta | Modal | RunPod | SkyPilot | Kubernetes |
|--|---------|-------|--------|----------|------------|
| NL goal interface | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| 4-cloud arbitrage | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Partial | ❌ |
| 1Hz self-healing | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Signed audit log | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Multi-agent AI | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Sub-30s provision | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Defensibility (bottom of slide):**
- **Data moat**: OrMind learns from every job outcome — gets smarter with scale
- **Integration depth**: Provider APIs + customer ML pipelines create switching costs
- **Enterprise trust**: HMAC audit trail + SOC2 path = compliance checkbox other tools miss

## Slide 10 — Go-To-Market

**Headline:** "Three phases. Zero to $500K ARR in 18 months."

**Visual:** Timeline with three phases

```
Phase 1 (Months 1–3): Direct Outreach          Target: 10 customers
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Direct outreach to AI startup CTOs via LinkedIn + cold email
• Offer: Free GPU waste audit + 14-day trial
• Target: Series A/B companies with $20K+/month GPU bills

Phase 2 (Months 4–6): Community Launch          Target: +30 customers
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Hacker News Show HN + Product Hunt launch
• ML Twitter/X content: GPU cost optimization tips (top of funnel)
• Developer blog: "We analyzed 1,000 GPU jobs. Here's the waste."

Phase 3 (Months 7–12): Partnerships             Target: +10 enterprise
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• CoreWeave referral partnership (aligned: we drive their revenue)
• Hugging Face / Weights & Biases marketplace integrations
