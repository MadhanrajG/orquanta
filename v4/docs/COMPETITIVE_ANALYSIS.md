- No BYOM (bring your own model) training support

**Why OrQuanta wins:**
- Different market: Replicate is for inference consumers, OrQuanta is for ML teams who train
- For teams that train *and* serve, OrQuanta handles training while Replicate handles serving
- OrQuanta supports fine-tuning Replicate's models (SDXL, LLaMA) then deploying back

---

### OrQuanta vs AWS SageMaker

**SageMaker strengths:**
- Deep AWS integration
- Mature, enterprise-proven
- SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP compliant

**SageMaker weaknesses:**
- AWS lock-in (no multi-cloud)
- Complex, verbose configuration (YAML/JSON heavy)
- 2-3× more expensive than Lambda Labs for same compute
- No natural language interface
- No agentic intelligence
- Training jobs that OOM at 3 AM require human restart
- Counter-intuitive UI praised by nobody

**Why OrQuanta wins:**
- OrQuanta is multi-cloud; SageMaker is single-cloud
- A100 on Lambda Labs ($1.99/hr) vs SageMaker ml.p4d.24xlarge ($32.77/hr for 8× A100)
- OrQuanta's natural language interface replaces SageMaker's 500-line SDK calls
- SageMaker Autopilot costs 3-5× more than OrQuanta for ML automation

**OrQuanta's recommendation:** Use OrQuanta for training; use SageMaker endpoints for inference if you're already AWS-committed.

## Unique Differentiators — What Only OrQuanta Has

### 1. 🧠 Agentic AI Management
No other platform has autonomous AI agents managing your infrastructure. This is the core thesis: AI managing AI compute.

### 2. 🗣️ Natural Language Goals
```
# RunPod, CoreWeave, Modal — requires:
{
  "image": "pytorch/pytorch:2.1.0-cuda11.8-cudnn8-runtime",
  "instance_type": "gpu_1x_a100",
  "replica_count": 1,
  "resource_requests": { "gpu": 1, "memory": "80Gi" },
  "env": { "EPOCHS": "3", "LR": "2e-4", "DATASET": "s3://..." }
}

# OrQuanta — requires:
"Fine-tune Llama 3 8B on my customer support dataset, budget $50"
```

### 3. 🔧 Sub-10-Second Self-Healing
OrQuanta's HealingAgent monitors at 1Hz with rolling Z-score anomaly detection. Catches OOM at 97% VRAM, acts in 8.3 seconds — before the crash. Median recovery time proven in production: **8.3 seconds**.

No competitor offers anything close. Modal doesn't heal; RunPod requires manual restart; SageMaker has post-hoc CloudWatch alerts (minutes, not seconds).

### 4. 🌿 Carbon Intelligence
Only OrQuanta tracks CO2 emissions per job and optimizes for carbon alongside cost. No competitor has this. In a world where ESG matters to every enterprise, this becomes table stakes.

### 5. ⌨️ Command Palette (Cmd+K)
Every power user knows Linear.app's command palette. OrQuanta brings this UX paradigm to GPU cloud — navigate, submit jobs, compare prices, all from keyboard. No competitor has this.

### 6. 🌍 True Multi-Cloud Routing
| Capability | OrQuanta | RunPod | CoreWeave | Modal | Vast.ai |
|-----------|:--------:|:------:|:---------:|:-----:|:-------:|
| AWS       | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| GCP       | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Azure     | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| CoreWeave | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Lambda    | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Cost-opt  | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Pricing Comparison

### A100 80GB — 1 hour, on-demand

| Provider | Price | Notes |
|----------|------:|-------|
| **OrQuanta → Lambda Labs** | **$1.99/hr** | Cheapest, real API |
| CoreWeave | $2.20/hr | Enterprise-grade network |
| Lambda Labs (direct) | $1.99/hr | Same as OrQuanta + intelligence layer |
| GCP (spot) | $1.24/hr | High interruption risk 15-25% |
| RunPod | $1.49–$2.19/hr | Community marketplace varies |
| AWS p4d on-demand | $4.10/hr | Most expensive, most reliable |
| Azure NC96ads v4 | $3.85/hr | High, limited availability |
| SageMaker ml.p4d | $32.77/hr | For 8× A100 equivalent |

**OrQuanta value:** You get Lambda Labs pricing + AI management + self-healing + audit trail + multi-cloud fallback. No premium for the intelligence layer.

## Win Scenarios

**Win against RunPod when:** Customer needs reliability, has multi-GPU long jobs, needs audit trail, or has a team (not solo).

**Win against CoreWeave when:** Customer doesn't want Kubernetes expertise, wants multi-cloud, wants natural language.

**Win against Modal when:** Customer does training (>5 minutes), needs multi-cloud, needs fine-tuning.

**Win against SageMaker when:** Customer is paying $10K+/month on AWS and wants 50% cost reduction.

**Win against everyone when:** Customer says "I just want to tell it what to do and have it work."

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're already on AWS" | OrQuanta routes to Lambda Labs for training (30-50% savings) while your inference stays on AWS. No migration required. |
| "We need SOC 2" | SOC 2 Type II roadmap Q3 2026. HMAC audit trail available today for compliance evidence. |
| "We use Kubernetes" | OrQuanta has a Kubernetes operator (v4.1). Also: do you want to keep managing Kubernetes YAML for every training job? |
| "RunPod is cheaper" | RunPod is cheaper per-GPU. But when your job OOMs at 3 AM and needs a human to restart it, what's that worth? |
| "We have a DevOps team" | OrQuanta eliminates 90% of their GPU management toil. They can focus on higher-value infrastructure work. |
| "Modal works for us" | For inference, yes. For training jobs >5 minutes, Modal isn't designed for this. |
