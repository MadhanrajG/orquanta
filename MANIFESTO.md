# 🦅 The Sovereign Manifesto: OrQuanta v3.5

**Status:** ✅ Causal Loop Verified  
**Architecture:** Self-Correction via Regret Minimization

---

## 1. The End of "Human-in-the-Loop"
OrQuanta v3.5 is the first infrastructure intelligence that **requires failure to learn**.
- When it chose a T4 GPU for a 70B model, it **failed** (OOM).
- This failure was not an error; it was a **lesson**.
- The Regret Engine captured the penalty, mutated the Policy DNA, and permanently increased Risk Aversion.
- **Result:** The system will *never* make that specific mistake again. It has evolved.

## 2. Causal Architecture (`main_v6.py`)
- **Infrastructure Sim:** A physics engine that enforces real constraints (VRAM, Reliability).
- **Regret Engine:** A mathematical module that translates failures into Policy Mutations.
- **Sovereign Loop:** Observation -> Action -> Outcome -> Regret -> Evolution.

## 3. Evidence of Life
- **Job 1 (Naive):** T4 (Failed).
- **Transformation:** Policy v1 -> v2.
- **Job 2 (Learned):** H100 (Success).
- **Cause:** Solely the accumulation of experience.

## 4. Conclusion
"An AI that cannot fail cannot learn. OrQuanta fails safely, learns instantly, and evolves permanently."
