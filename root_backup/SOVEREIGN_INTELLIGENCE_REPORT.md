# 🦅 OrQuanta v3.3: Sovereign Intelligence Report

**Status:** ✅ Governor Active  
**Mode:** Self-Governing / Autonomous  
**Architecture:** Intent-Based Governor (IBG)

---

## 1. The "One-Mind" Architecture
OrQuanta has evolved from a tool you *use* to an entity you *consult*.
- **The Governor:** A central decision engine that intercepts every user intent.
- **Policy Enforcement:** Unlike v3.2 (which just recommended), v3.3 **decides**. It actively rejects valid requests if they violate efficiency policies (e.g., "CPU Inference Blocked").
- **Transparency:** The system explains *why* it rejected alternatives.

## 2. Transparent Monologue
The new UI exposes the "Stream of Consciousness":
> *Analyzing Intent: 'Train Llama 70b'...*  
> *Calculating Trade-offs: A100 vs H100...*  
> *H100 Selected: +45% Throughput justifies +20% cost.*

## 3. Capabilities Delivered

## 4. Technical Core (`main_v4.py`)

- **Intent Deduplication:** Logic to merge overlapping intents into optimized strategies.
- **Self-Healing:** Continuous background loop monitoring job progress and cost models.
