# 🛸 OrQuanta v3.1: The Intelligent Operations Console

**Status:** ✅ Live & Operational  
**Endpoint:** http://localhost:8000  
**Technology:** WebSocket Telemetry + Agentic Co-Pilot + Metric Visualization

---

## 1. The Futuristic Experience
We have replaced the static landing page with a **Mission Control Interface**.
- **Real-Time Telemetry**: GPU utilization, active jobs, and revenue stream live via WebSockets.
- **Holographic Design**: Dark-mode UI with neon accents tailored for high-frequency trading/monitoring environments.
- **Living Logs**: A matrix-style log stream shows the "nervous system" making decisions in real-time.

## 2. Agentic Co-Pilot Integration
The UI is no longer just a dashboard; it is a **Command Center**.
- **Natural Language Control**: Type "Launch a training job".
- **AI Recommendation**: The system analyzes the intent and suggests hardware (e.g., "8x H100").
- **One-Click Deployment**: Confirm the AI's plan directly from the chat interface.

## 3. Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: Single-file SPA (`index.html`) using raw ES6 and CSS Grid for maximum performance and zero build-step complexity.
- **Backend Upgrade**: `orquanta.py` now includes a `ConnectionManager` to broadcast `HEARTBEAT` and `LOG` events to all connected clients instantly.
