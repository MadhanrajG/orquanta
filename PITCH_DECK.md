# 🦄 OrQuanta: The AI Cloud that Thinks

**Mission:** To build the world's first **Autonomous Infrastructure Organism**.

---

## 📉 The Problem
- **AWS is Dumb:** Static VMs don't know *what* runs on them.
- **DevOps is Expensive:** $200k/yr engineers spend 40% of time fixing broken pods.
- **Utilization is Low:** GPUs sit idle 60% of the time.

## 🚀 The OrQuanta Solution
We replaced the DevOps team with a **OrMind**.
1.  **Agentic Dispatch:** You don't pick GPUs. The agent picks for you based on 10,000 previous runs.
2.  **Self-Healing:** Crashes are caught in milliseconds. Jobs migrate instantly.
3.  **Closed-Loop:** The system gets smarter with every job run.

## 📊 Traction (v3.0 Live)
- **Tech:** Fully functional "Living System" deployed.
- **Validation:** 100% Pass rate on autonomous healing tests.
- **Economics:** 20% cheaper than AWS via intelligent spot-arbitrage.

## 💰 The Ask
**Series A - $15M** to scale the physical GPU cluster to match our software intelligence.
